## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D1C4E9) to promote calmness and relaxation.
- Background color: Light off-white (#F5F5F5) for a gentle, unobtrusive feel.
- Accent color: Pale blue (#B3E5FC) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Literata' will give a vintage, slightly formal feel that will combine well with the clean and modern 'PT Sans', providing good readability
- Use simple, embedded SVG icons (moon, stars) for key actions and navigation.
- Mobile-first responsive design with a focus on clear, short content blocks. Ensure AA contrast levels.
- Subtle, smooth transitions for tab navigation and accordion open/close actions.
